Graco airless paint sprayers are workhorses for professional painters, enabling them to apply paint quickly and efficiently.

## Understanding Graco Airless Paint Sprayer Tip Guards

Tip guards are essentially shields that safeguard your sprayer tip from various hazards, including:

* **Drops and bumps:** Accidental drops or bumps during transportation or use can cause nicks and dents on the tip, compromising its performance and potentially leading to leaks.
* **Overspray:** Paint spraying can result in overspray, where paint mist travels beyond the intended target area. This overspray can land on the tip, accumulating and drying, making it difficult to clean and affecting spray patterns.
* **Clogged tips:** Clogged tips are a frequent occurrence, particularly when using paints with a thick consistency or containing debris. Tip guards can help prevent paint buildup on the tip, minimizing clogging and ensuring smooth operation.
